technical steps:
I completely leant on the example we discusses in the class.
Expect for the Battlemechanic.
There I used the singletonpattern so that two users can fight together.
Kinda like a lobby where the first user has to wait till a second player wants to fight.
For trading I used the database to store a card if a player wants to trade it till a second player wants this card.
The rest is like in the example from the class.

unit tests:
For the unit-tests I tried to test methods where the outcome has to be working once and the second time where it doesn't work.
But for some methods it's not really possible to have an negative outcome.

time:
about 50h
